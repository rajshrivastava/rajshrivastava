### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Raj - a curious Computer Science Master's student at North Carolina State University!

#### About me

I am a Graduate Research Assistant at Innovative Educational Computing Laboratory at my university. I am currently working on a skill model mining for automatically detecting inherent skills taught in an online courseware. I am enthusiastic about different domains in computer science ranging from software development to machine learning!

Having a strong grasp of data structures and algorithms, I am confident about my design and coding abilities.

Currently, I am actively looking for a full-time role in software development or machine learning. With an organized and disciplined attitude and an appetite to learn and grow, I would be glad to contribute with my skills and make an impact.
